This package proposes to assess the impact of vaccination campaigns using the following methods:

- Number of events averted by vaccination (NAE)
- Number of events avertable by increasing the vaccine coverage (NAbE)
- Number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one event

# Mathematical Formulas

## 1. Number of events averted by vaccination (NAE)

The number of events averted by vaccination at time $t$ is calculated as:

$$NAE_t = e_{A(t)} \frac{VC_t VE_t}{(1 - VC_t VE_t)}$$

with:

- $e_{A(t)}$: Number of events at time $t$
- $VE_t$: Vaccine effectiveness at time $t$
- $VC_t$: Vaccine coverage at time $t$

## 2. Number of avertable events considering an increase in final coverage (NAbE)

The number of averted events with alpha parameter at time $t$:

$$NAbE_t(\alpha) = e_{A(t)} \frac{VC(\alpha)_t VE_t}{(1 - VC(\alpha)_t VE_t)}$$

with:

- $e_{A(t)}$: Number of events at time $t$
- $VC(\alpha)_t$: Hypothetical vaccine coverage during time $t$ if the vaccine coverage was increased by a factor of alpha parameter
- $VE_t$: Vaccine effectiveness at time $t$

$VC(\alpha)_t$ is computed as:

$$VC_t(\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^{t} (VC_t - VC_{t-1}) \left(1 + \frac{\alpha}{VC_T}\right)$$

with:

- $VC_t$: Vaccine coverage at time $t$ ($VC_0 = 0$)
- $VC_{t-1}$: Vaccine coverage at time $t-1$
- $\alpha$: Increase in final vaccine coverage
- $VC_T$: Maximum vaccine coverage observed

## 3. Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNV)

The number needed to vaccinate at time $t$ is calculated as:

$$NNV_t = \frac{1}{R_{B(t)} VE_t}$$

where $$R_{B(t)} = \frac{e_{A(t)} + NAE_t}{N_t}$$, $R_{B(t)}$ represents the rate of events expected in a counterfactual population without a vaccination program

with:

- $VE_t$: Vaccine effectiveness at time $t$
- $e_{A(t)}$: Number of events at time $t$
- $NAE_t$: Number of events averted by vaccination at time $t$
- $N_t$: Population at risk at time $t$

# Example

We use some toy data to illustrate the usage of the package.

```{r example}
data(coverage_and_incidence_mock_data)
coverage <- coverage_and_incidence_mock_data$coverage_data
incidence <- coverage_and_incidence_mock_data$incidence_data
vaccine_effectiveness <- ve_mock_data$ve
```

## NAE

```{r}
nae <- compute_events_averted_by_vaccination(
  events = incidence$events,
  cumulative_coverage = coverage$cumulative_coverage,
  vaccine_effectiveness = vaccine_effectiveness
)
nae
```

## NAbE

```{r}
nabe <- compute_events_avertable_by_increasing_coverage(
  events = incidence$events,
  diff_cumulative_coverage = c(0, diff(coverage$cumulative_coverage)),
  target_coverage = max(coverage$cumulative_coverage),
  alpha = 0.1, # 10% increase in final coverage
  vaccine_effectiveness = vaccine_effectiveness
)
nabe
```

It is also possible to compute the number of avertable events for many values of alpha:

```{r}
nabe_many_alphas <- compute_events_avertable_by_increasing_coverage_many_alphas(
  events = incidence$events,
  diff_cumulative_coverage = c(0, diff(coverage$cumulative_coverage)),
  target_coverage = max(coverage$cumulative_coverage),
  alphas = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3),
  vaccine_effectiveness = vaccine_effectiveness
)
nabe_many_alphas
```

## NNV

```{r}
initial_pop_at_risk <- 1000
pop_at_risk <- initial_pop_at_risk - cumsum(incidence$events)

nnv <- compute_number_needed_to_vaccinate(
  events = incidence$events,
  events_averted = nae,
  pop_at_risk = pop_at_risk,
  vaccine_effectiveness = vaccine_effectiveness
)
nnv
```
